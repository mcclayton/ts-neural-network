# TS Neural Networks

This repo implements a Neural Network in TypeScript without libraries like TensorFlow. It includes an example application where an AI-driven player
must learn how to navigate to the finish line while avoiding boundaries and enemies. Upon each run, the AI Brain (Neural Network State) is mutated slightly
and the best Neural Net State can be saved and re-loaded.
